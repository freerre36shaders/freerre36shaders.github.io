            <h2>Why did you make this website?</h2>
            <p>I made this website to share all of RRe36's shaderpacks, including the paid ones. I don't like having to pay for Minecraft shaderpacks.</p>
            <h2>How did you acquire these shaders?</h2>
            <p>I actually didn't pay for any of these shaders, as I found them for free after scouring the internet for a while.</p>
            <h2>Isn't this illegal?</h2>
            <p>Yes, but I don't care lol.</p>
