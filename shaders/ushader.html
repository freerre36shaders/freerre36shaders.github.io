            <h2>What is the UShader?</h2>
            <p>This shaderpack has a, to some degree, special nostalgic value to RRe36 since she designed it to recreate a heavily modified version of SEUS v10.1 that she'd been using for a few years without using any code from it, making it possible for her to release it publicly without having to worry about any copyright issues. It recreates quite a bit of the unique look that her modified SEUS v10.1 had, which includes the distinct lighting the original pack had that obviously carried through to her modification and now to this pack, while outperforming it by a lot, even with some new effects that added that her original modification did not have. An example for one of these effects would be the volumetric fog it features.</p>
            <p>Latest Version: v2.1
